A chaotic co-op platformer where you try to help each other survive for the given amount of time while competing to earn more points.
The lava will rise up to a certain point of the screen and drop back down after reaching that point. During this phase, as long as one player is alive, the other will respawn.

Written in Java. Uses [Processing](https://processing.org/) library for graphics.
